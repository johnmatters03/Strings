Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

It is not possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to verify the destination
memory is large enough, because for both array and pointer 
implementations, the only paramenter passed into the function is a 
pointer to the beginning of the array. Since, by design, C arrays don't
have an end marker, the only way to know if the destination memory area
is sufficiently large is to know the length of the array in advance.
